Some work from Master of Data Science 



#Project 1 - [AirBnb Data Analysis](AirBnb Data Analysis Project.pdf)

##Overview
To analysis Airbnb data from 2019 to 2020, find out the factors that affect the price and the booking. Also generate a prediction model to suggest what facility and which location can help boost up the price and booking enquiries.

##Task
- Use R to do data cleaning and manipulation, clustering, and correlation test to isolate necessary feature
- Use NLP and SVM to build regression model, to identify what feature affects the renting price and build a prediction model.
- Use Tableau and R markdown for reporting.

##Notes
As the only one in the team has 10 years of coding experience, I handle a bit more coding than others than others.
The whole team design what features we need for analysis/prediction, and I help with coding. 
Each of us involved all the K-mean clustering, Regression model, analysis and visualization. 
I only work a bit more on NLP/SVM.
